# Taxi Demand Prediction
Marketplace forecasting is a critical element for any transportation company. By predicting the amount of supply and demand in different time frames for each location, drivers can be directed to areas with high demand, thus increasing the number of trips and earnings.

This project is focused on demand prediction for each taxi zone in NYC. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains the yellow taxi trip records for the first four months of 2023 which include 12672629 trip data made between 263 different taxi zones in NYC. This dataset includes fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
